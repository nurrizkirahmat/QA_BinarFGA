# QA_BinarFGA

Hello everyone, this is my first project in Quality Assurance
Here, I'm testing a website from Binar while undergoing training "https://secondhand.binaracademy.org/", a website containing the sale of goods or e-commerce
I use the Katalon Studio application during training by making several kinds of test case  in manual test, script test and spy web methode to save in Object Repository. 
1. User Login
2. User Bargain a Product
3. User Bargain in Detail Product

In the first test case, there is negative testing and positive testing. Apart from that, there is also a Test Suite and Bug Reporting of the tests that were run.
File of Project in Katalon available in Master branch
